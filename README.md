# Bamazon

Bamazon is a node application that uses a mysql database. It is an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes orders from customers and changes the information in the mysql database based on what and how much the customer buys. Additionally, the Manager of Bamazon is able to keep track of their products inventory so they can view what products they have, which products have a low inventory, add to the current inventories as well as add additional products.
